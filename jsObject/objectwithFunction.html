            work flow of this function
            ---------------------------
            1. fullName function was declared within the myObj Object
            2. It has the parameter named firstName, to return the value from function call
            3. But in this case, there is a same name with fullName's parameter, which is the property that assigned key ('Aung')
            4. Ihe program has a call for this fullName function, but this function will return non of properties from myObj object. 
            5. It will return the value outside of this array, It can be user input.
            6. But it will remain as a return value in myObj.
            7. in this case, if we use the 'this' keywords, the property which has the same with parameter, will return to the function call.
            8. Therefore, we can uunderstand that 'this' keyword is used when we would like to avoid the confusion when same name within the program.

            //return firstName;
            return this.firstName;
        }

    console.log (myObj.fullName(name));

    document.getElementById ('testing').innerHTML = myObj.fullName(name);

    // let result = myObj.fullName (name);

    // document.getElementById ('testing').innerHTML = result;
