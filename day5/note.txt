1. Array push is used to add the data from the last index number of the array.
2. Unshift is used to add the data from the first index of the array.
3. Pop is used to delete the data from the last index number.
4. shift is used to delete the data from the first index number of the array.
5. Length is used to show the length of the array.


Error handling
- ------------------------- -
Error handling is need when we used the API call. Why?
We can be know or we can avoid the error in our code, However,
When the error happens from the API call, we can be freak and our code can't run. That is why we use the error handling in our code.
Especially, we use this when the most error happen place, for example API call


try {

    In the try block code, we usually put the most error happen code

}catch (error or whatevever you need) { // catch has the parameter to catch the such proper error name and the error happen, it will return the error type
    when the error happen in try block code, our program will not kill and run the catch block code
}


Array Destructuring in ES6 Vs old model
- -------------------------- -
1. Destructuring is used to copy the array or object. We can also used the spread operator

let var const
- ------------------------- -
1. Var is like public variable in java. 
2. If the variable was declared with var, the program define as golobal variable.
3. If the variable was declared without var, let and const, it is defined as var.


continue and beak
- ----------------------  -
1. we can't use the continue and break in foreach.
2. Continue is used to skip accroding to the condition statement, and continue excute the rest of code
3. Break is used to stop the excution when the condition statement is true, and stop the excution the rest of code.


concat built-in function 
- -------------------------- -
1. Concat is used to combine the different array

Spread operator
- ---------------------- -
1. Spread Operator is used to replace the concat
2. It is mainly used to copy or clone the data
3. Syntx for the spread is ... and the it is the new feature of the JS ES6
4. ... is represented the properties of the array or object.

rest parameter vs spread operator
- ---------------------- - 
1. Both have same syntx however, functions are different
2. ... is called when the array or object value are copying or cloing, but in other place, it can't be the spread operator.
3. If we have the function in our program, the function returns the value which was catched by the parameter of the function and show.
   In this case, function return value can be very long string, int, and etc.., so the function might need very long parameter according to the fucntion return value.
   Rest parameter can solove this issue by giving the common parameter name and rest parameter (...)
   But rest parameter can store the data as an array.
   So, rest parameter is unlimited array, memory usage is directly impact to userInput.

Map function
- ---------------------- -
1. Map function is used to change the intial value with the some processing.
2. Map function is mainly used in real world project.
